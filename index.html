					<h1>Park and Slide</h1>
					<p>On the 4th May 2014 this giant 95m (300ft) water slide was installed on Park Street in Bristol as part of Make Sunday Special and the Bristol Art Weekender. Running for one day only, it was an event people of the city will remember for many years to come.</p>
					<p>96,573 people signed up for their chance to get a ‘ticket to slide’, through a ballot with only 360 tickets issued to a few lucky people on the day. Security clocked in 65,000 people who came to Park street to watch the one day event.</p>
					<p>Enabling people to navigate the streets of their city in a new way, the slide is a simple architectural intervention and a playful response to the urban landscape. Like many of Jerram’s projects the installation requires public participation to be activated. The person on the slide becomes the performer, while spectators either side watch on. The end result is a set of collective memories and stories that people will pass on.</p>
					<blockquote>This massive urban slide transforms the street and asked people to take a fresh look at the potential of their city and the possibilities for transformation. Imagine if there were permanent slides right across cities?</blockquote>
					<p>With an incline of 6.5 degrees, participants slid at an average of 18km/hr = 11.2mph (calculated from this film). The slide was used by children and adults ranging in age from 5 to 73 years old.</p>
          <p> As news of the Park and Slide spread around the globe, other cities were inspired to install their own urban slides. Our DIY pack has proved vital for many of these organisations in helping to get their project off the ground.  See links for urban slides in San Francisco, Perth, Brechin, Sunderland, Camarthen, Lincoln, Bray, Derby, Chard, Derry, Wigan, Dungannon, Bristol USA, Salt Lake City, Melbourne, Port Hope-Canada, Norwich.</p>

			<p>A grammar vigilante armed with a specialist ‘apostrophiser’ device has spent 13 years curing Bristol of its bad punctuation. The anonymous grammarian, who by day has a full-time job, spends his nights under cover, using a bespoke tool to fix business signs across the city.</p>

			<p>“I’m a grammar vigilante,” said the so-called ‘Banksy of bad grammar’, who has been operating in Bristol for 13 years.</p>

			<p>“I do take it to heart. I have been doing it for quite a lot of years now. I do think it’s a cause worth pursuing.”</p>


			<p> To those who call his work criminal, he adds: “I would say to them it’s more of a crime to have the apostrophe wrong in the first place. I think I can do it without causing too much offence.”</p>

			<p>Rogue apostrophes – or no apostrophes where they are needed – ‘just make me feel gross’, he says.</p>

			<p>“This is just wrong, it’s not meant to be like this, it really does need to be sorted out.”</p>
