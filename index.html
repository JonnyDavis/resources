		<div class="col-md-4">
			<p>A grammar vigilante armed with a specialist ‘apostrophiser’ device has spent 13 years curing Bristol of its bad punctuation. The anonymous grammarian, who by day has a full-time job, spends his nights under cover, using a bespoke tool to fix business signs across the city.</p>

			<p>“I’m a grammar vigilante,” said the so-called ‘Banksy of bad grammar’, who has been operating in Bristol for 13 years.</p>

			<p>“I do take it to heart. I have been doing it for quite a lot of years now. I do think it’s a cause worth pursuing.”</p>


			<p> To those who call his work criminal, he adds: “I would say to them it’s more of a crime to have the apostrophe wrong in the first place. I think I can do it without causing too much offence.”</p>

			<p>Rogue apostrophes – or no apostrophes where they are needed – ‘just make me feel gross’, he says.</p>

			<p>“This is just wrong, it’s not meant to be like this, it really does need to be sorted out.”</p>
