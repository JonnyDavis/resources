    <h1>Bristol's Alien Squid Mystery</h1>

      <h2>Bristol became the location of a strange alien sighting. A strange, glowing squid swimming through the murky waters of Bristol docks was caught on camera by multiple on lookers.</h2>

      <p>Twitter users speculated that the glowing creature could have been anything from an animal which has escaped from Bristol Zoo to Father Christmas' underwater sleigh. </p>

      <h2> Solved: <b> Blame it on Barry </b>

      <h1>Billy 'The Fish' Fisher</h1>

    </h2> Have you noticed how cold it is in the Odeon Cinema? It might just have been a heating malfunction or, as they say in the business, a ‘cold spot’ – the presence of something supernatural.</h2>

    <p> 6.25pm on May 29, 1946, the Odeon was screening a Hollywood adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s The Light That Failed to an audience of around 2,000 people (the cinema was a lot bigger back then).

    During the film, five shots were fired on-screen, followed by a sixth heard in the Odeon manager’s office. The case was never officially closed, but the manager’s killer was believed to be a man named Billy 'The Fish' Fisher, who confessed the killing on his deathbed. Cinema three is now said to be haunted by the ghost of the murdered manager.</p>
